###Heap ADT Implementation 

insertionSort.h - Header file for insertion sort algorithm.

insertionSort.c - implementation file for insertion sort algorithm.

heapSort.h - header file for heap sort algorithm.

heapSort.c - implementation file for heap sort alogirth.

sortComp.c - Creates sortComp executable that compares the "run" time of both algorithms.

sortPrint.c - Creates sortPrint executable that prints the results of both algorithms

Heap.h - Header file containing all function declarations for the heap ADT.

Heap.c - Implements the functions for the Heap ADT

heapDriver.c - File that "tests" the Heap ADT implementation to check if all the methods are working. 

Makefile - Creates an executable programs "heapDriver", "sortComp" and "sortPrint" that can be run from the command line. Required input is as follows:

./main filein

README - you're reading it!

Results from experimentation: Confusing. Insertion sort seems to run quicker than heap sort.
